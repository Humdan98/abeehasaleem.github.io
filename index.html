    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>My love for cooking and baking began in my childhood. I enjoy the balance of science and creativity in baking, the precision it requires, and the joy it brings when a cake rises perfectly or a loaf turns golden.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I’ve explored everything from soft breads to rich layered cakes and fusion desserts. Currently, I bake regularly at home, take part in online baking communities, and try new recipes every week.</p>
    <p>My dream is to one day open my own bakery — a warm, inviting space where I can share handmade goods, inspired by both tradition and innovation.</p>
